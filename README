This is the modification of original Attachment mod from daris at github 
https://github.com/daris/fluxbb-attachment-mod suitable for Postgresql 
installations. Since syntax of SQL queries in AP_Attachment_mod.php and in 
attachment.php are not working properly under postgresql environment, 
I rewrote queries in order to make it usable. Everything is the same as 
in the version 2.1.4 of that mod located here: 

http://fluxbb.org/resources/mods/attachment-mod/

I hope it will be useful.
